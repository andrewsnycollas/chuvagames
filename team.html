                <h3>André Borba - Producer / Community Manager</h3>
                <p>André was born in 1992 and has been passionate about technology from an early age. His curiosity about how computers work began when he received his first PC, a Pentium III, in the late '90s. His first video game was a NES, followed by the SNES, PS1, PS2, and eventually an Xbox 360. He studied classical piano and keyboard for seven years at SESI, performing in his first recital at age 12. During his teenage years, he shifted from piano to bass and formed his first hardcore band at 17, which lasted until he was 23.</p>

                <h3>Camila Sales - 2D Artist</h3>
                <p>Graduated in Game Development since 2017 and currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Digital Animation. I discovered the world of drawing as a child, like many artists, starting with sketches of Dragon Ball. I grew up and dedicated myself to various forms of drawing and painting, from pencil and paper to canvas painting. In 2020, I bought my first tablet and began exploring Digital Painting, shortly after which I started studying 2D Digital Animation. Art, in general, has always been my escape, and returning to the gaming industry will be challenging yet exciting.</p>
